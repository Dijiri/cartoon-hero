        <h2>What Is This?</h2>
        <p>This website was 
            created so I can organize my thoughts and projects
            for any future coding endeavors.</p>

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Dimitrius Tenorio! I am currently a college student
            studying at Colorado State University. I'm 18
            years old, and I only recently got back into
            coding. I took a break for a long while
            because it was too hard for me to learn things on
            my own when I was younger. 
            <br> Now that I'm older, 
            I have access to more resources and I'm more motivated to
            seek out the knowledge I want to obtain. 
            <br> <br> My main language
            I'm working with is Java although I do have some knowledge on
            <b>Python</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Old Projects</h2>
        <ul>I used a tutorial on YouTube to 
            develop a snake game in Java. I implemented my own "high score"
            mechanic and am currently trying to fix the enemy spawn
            locations so it does not spawn inside the snake.
            <br>I am also having issues with exporting this game
            as a .jar --> .exe file but whenever I get that sorted, I 
            will post it here so you can play it yourself.
